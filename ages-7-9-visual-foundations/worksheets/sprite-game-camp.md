### 🏃‍♂️ Physical Activity: Sprite Movement Dance (10 min)

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Dance Instructor Ms. Code:</strong><br>
"Before we program our sprites to move, let's BE sprites ourselves! We'll practice different character movements and emotions through dance. This helps us understand how to make our digital characters move naturally!"
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Movement Commands:</strong><br>
When I call out a sprite action, everyone performs it:<br>
"Walk like a robot!" "Bounce like a ball!" "Sneak like a ninja!" "Spin like a tornado!"
</div>

</div>

**Character Movement Library:**
- 🤖 **Robot Walk** - Stiff, mechanical movements
- 🐰 **Bunny Hop** - Quick little jumps
- 👻 **Ghost Float** - Smooth, floating motions  
- 🦋 **Butterfly Flutter** - Gentle, graceful movements
- 🦁 **Lion Prowl** - Strong, confident steps
- 🐧 **Penguin Waddle** - Side-to-side walking
- 🏃‍♂️ **Sprint Dash** - Fast running in place
- 😴 **Sleepy Shuffle** - Slow, tired movements

**Movement to Code Translation:**
After each dance move, discuss how we'd program it:
- Robot Walk = "Move 10 steps, wait 0.5 seconds, repeat"
- Bunny Hop = "Change y by 20, wait, change y by -20"
- Spin = "Turn 36 degrees, repeat 10 times"
