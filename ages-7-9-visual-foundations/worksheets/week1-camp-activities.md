### 🎮 Activity Station 1: Block Building Race (20 min)

**Materials Needed:**
- Physical LEGO blocks or paper "code blocks"
- Timer
- Instruction cards

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ms. Code explains:</strong><br>
"Before we code on computers, let's understand how instructions work! You'll build physical block towers following specific instructions - just like computers follow our code blocks!"
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Camper Challenge:</strong><br>
"Can we build faster if we work as a team? What happens if we skip a step in the instructions?"
</div>

</div>

**Round 1: Solo Building**
```
Instructions:
1. Place red block on table
2. Stack blue block on red
3. Add yellow block on top
4. Place green block beside tower
```

**Round 2: Team Building** 
```
Instructions:
1. Partner A places foundation blocks
2. Partner B adds middle layer  
3. Both add decorative top together
4. High-five when complete!
```

**Reflection Questions:**
- What happened when instructions were unclear?
- How is this like giving instructions to a computer?

<strong>Ms. Code's Game:</strong><br>
"Let's BE the sprites! One camper will be the 'programmer' giving block instructions, others will be 'sprites' following the commands. This helps us understand how clear instructions need to be!"
