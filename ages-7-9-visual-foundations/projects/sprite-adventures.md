# 🎭 Sprite Adventures - Interactive Character Games

## 🌟 Learning Through Character-Based Play

Young programmers learn best when they can create and control characters that feel alive! These sprite-based projects use visual programming blocks to teach fundamental coding concepts through engaging character interactions and adventures.

## 🏃‍♂️ Project 1: My Pet Adventure

### Game Concept
Create a virtual pet that students can feed, play with, and care for using visual programming blocks.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ms. Code's Teaching Goals:</strong><br>
"This project introduces variables (pet stats), conditionals (if pet is hungry), and user interaction through a beloved character. Students learn cause-and-effect programming while caring for their digital companion."
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Alex's Pet Dreams:</strong><br>
"I want my pet dragon to breathe different colored fire when it's happy! Can I teach it tricks? And maybe it could have different moods and expressions?"
