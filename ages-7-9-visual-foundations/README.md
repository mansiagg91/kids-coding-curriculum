<strong>Ms. Code (Your Instructor):</strong><br>
"Hi there, future programmers! I'm Ms. Code, and I've been building computer programs for over 5 years. Did you know that coding is just like giving instructions to your computer friend? Just like how you follow a recipe to bake cookies, computers follow our code instructions!"

## 🎯 Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: Hello, Code Blocks! 👋
**Goal:** Learn what coding blocks are and how they work

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ms. Code Fun Fact:</strong><br>
"Visual blocks were invented to make coding as easy as playing with blocks! Each block represents one instruction for the computer."
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Alex wonders:</strong><br>
"If I put blocks in the wrong order, will my computer get confused?"
</div>

</div>

**Activities:**
- [ ] Meet your first sprite (computer character)
- [ ] Drag and drop your first code block
- [ ] Make your sprite say "Hello!"
- [ ] **Mini Challenge:** Make your sprite introduce itself with your name

---

### Week 2: Let's Get Moving! 🏃‍♂️
**Goal:** Control sprite movement and direction

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ms. Code's Tip:</strong><br>
"In real video games, programmers use coordinates (like a treasure map) to tell characters where to go. We'll use simple blocks to do the same!"
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Alex asks:</strong><br>
"Can I make my sprite do a backflip? Or slide across the screen like it's on ice?"
</div>

</div>

**Visual Block Example:**
```
┌─[When Flag Clicked]─┐
│                     │
├─[Move 10 Steps]─────┤
│                     │
├─[Turn 15 Degrees]───┤
│                     │
└─[Wait 1 Second]─────┘
```

**Activities:**
- [ ] Use movement blocks
- [ ] Create a square dance pattern
- [ ] **Challenge:** Make your sprite draw its name by walking

---

### Week 3: Sounds and Music! 🎵
**Goal:** Add audio elements to make projects interactive

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ms. Code explains:</strong><br>
"Sound makes programs come alive! I once worked on a system that played different sounds for different types of messages - just like notifications on your phone!"
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Alex exclaims:</strong><br>
"Ooh! Can I record my dog barking and use it in my program? What about making my own theme song?"
</div>

</div>

**Activities:**
- [ ] Add sound effects to sprite actions
- [ ] Create a musical sequence
- [ ] Record your own sounds
- [ ] **Super Challenge:** Create a simple drum machine

---

### Week 4: Interactive Stories! 📖
**Goal:** Create branching stories with user choices

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ms. Code's Secret:</strong><br>
"Interactive stories are like video games! They use 'if-then' logic - the same concept I used in big business software. If user clicks A, then show story path 1."
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Alex wonders:</strong><br>
"So I can make a story where people choose what happens next? Like 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books?"
</div>

</div>

**Block Flow:**
```
┌─[When Space Key Pressed]────┐
│                             │
├─[Ask "What's your name?"]───┤
│                             │
├─[Say "Hi " + Answer]────────┤
│                             │
└─[Wait for next choice]──────┘
```

---

### Week 5: Multiple Characters! 👫
**Goal:** Coordinate multiple sprites working together

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ms. Code shares:</strong><br>
"Working with multiple sprites is like managing a team project! Each sprite has its own job, but they need to communicate - just like different parts of big software systems."
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Alex dreams:</strong><br>
"Can I make a whole classroom of sprites? Maybe they can all have conversations with each other!"
</div>

</div>

**Activities:**
- [ ] Add second and third sprites
- [ ] Make sprites talk to each other
- [ ] Create a simple dialogue scene
- [ ] **Challenge:** Sprite talent show with different performances

---

### Week 6: Final Project Showcase! 🌟
**Goal:** Combine everything into an amazing creation

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Ms. Code celebrates:</strong><br>
"This is like launching your first software product! You'll present your creation just like professional developers show their work to clients."
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Alex beams:</strong><br>
"I can't wait to show my family what I built! Will other kids be able to play my game too?"
