<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Dr. Pythonia's Promise:</strong><br>
"By the end of this course, you'll:
• Transition from visual blocks to real Python code
• Build interactive games and apps
• Understand variables, loops, and functions
• Create projects you can share with friends
• Think like a professional programmer!"
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Jordan's Goals:</strong><br>
"I want to make a quiz game for my friends, create art with code, and maybe build a simple chatbot. Can I really do all that? And will I understand how video games work?"
</div>

## 📖 10-Week Curriculum

### Weeks 1-2: Bridge from Blocks to Code 🌉

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Dr. Pythonia explains:</strong><br>
"We'll start with familiar visual blocks that show the Python code underneath. It's like having subtitles for coding! You'll see how 'move 10 steps' becomes 'turtle.forward(10)' in Python."
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Jordan wonders:</strong><br>
"Oh! So the blocks were hiding real code inside? That's so cool! Can I see the code for all my old projects?"
</div>

</div>

**Visual Block to Python Translation:**

Block View:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ 🔄 repeat 5 times       │
├─────────────────────────┤
│   🔵 move forward 50    │
│   🟡 turn right 72°     │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

Python Code:
```python
for i in range(5):
    turtle.forward(50)
    turtle.right(72)
```

**Week Activities:**
- Explore block-to-code converter
- Create geometric patterns with turtle graphics
- Learn about variables with visual number boxes
- Build a digital pet that responds to commands

### Weeks 3-4: Python Foundations 🏗️

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Dr. Pythonia's insight:</strong><br>
"Now we dive into pure Python! Variables are like labeled boxes that store information. Functions are like custom blocks you create. We'll build these concepts through fun projects."
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Jordan discovers:</strong><br>
"So a variable is like naming my backpack 'inventory' and putting different items in it? And functions are like teaching the computer new tricks?"
</div>

</div>

**Core Concepts Through Games:**

**Variables in Action:**
```python
player_name = "Jordan"
score = 0
health = 100

print(f"Welcome, {player_name}!")
print(f"Your score: {score}")
print(f"Your health: {health}")
```

**Functions for Reusable Code:**
```python
def celebrate_win():
    print("🎉 You won!")
    print("🏆 Amazing job!")
    score = score + 10

def game_over():
    print("💀 Game Over")
    print("🔄 Try again?")
```

**Projects:**
- Name Generator using lists and randomization
- Simple Calculator with custom functions
- Interactive Story with user choices
- Basic Password Generator

### Weeks 5-6: Interactive Applications 🎮

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Dr. Pythonia reveals:</strong><br>
"Time for real interactivity! We'll use Python's input() function and conditional statements (if/else) to create programs that respond intelligently to users. This is how chatbots and games work!"
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Jordan gets excited:</strong><br>
"Wait, I can make programs that ask questions and give different answers based on what people say? That's like creating my own AI assistant!"
</div>

</div>

**Interactive Programming Patterns:**

**Smart Responses:**
```python
user_mood = input("How are you feeling today? ")

if user_mood == "happy":
    print("That's wonderful! Want to play a game?")
elif user_mood == "sad":
    print("I'm sorry to hear that. Here's a joke to cheer you up!")
else:
    print("Thanks for sharing! Let's code something fun!")
```

**Game Logic:**
```python
import random

number = random.randint(1, 100)
guesses = 0

while True:
    guess = int(input("Guess the number (1-100): "))
    guesses += 1
    
    if guess == number:
        print(f"You got it in {guesses} tries!")
        break
    elif guess < number:
        print("Too low!")
    else:
        print("Too high!")
```

**Major Projects:**
- Choose Your Own Adventure Game
- Math Quiz with Difficulty Levels
- Simple Chatbot with Personality
- Rock Paper Scissors Tournament

### Weeks 7-8: Creative Coding & Graphics 🎨

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; margin: 20px 0;">

<div style="width: 45%; background: #e8f4fd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Dr. Pythonia shares:</strong><br>
"Let's explore Python's creative side! We'll use libraries like turtle and tkinter to create graphics, animations, and even simple GUIs. This shows how Python is used in game development and digital art."
</div>

<div style="width: 45%; background: #fff3cd; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
<strong>Jordan imagines:</strong><br>
"Can I make digital art that moves? Maybe create my own paint program? Or build a simple game with buttons and windows like real apps?"
</div>

</div>

**Creative Projects:**

**Generative Art:**
```python
import turtle
import random

colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "purple", "orange"]
turtle.speed(0)
turtle.bgcolor("black")

for i in range(100):
    turtle.color(random.choice(colors))
    turtle.forward(random.randint(10, 100))
    turtle.right(random.randint(1, 360))
```

**Simple GUI Application:**
```python
import tkinter as tk

def button_clicked():
    label.config(text="Hello, " + entry.get() + "!")

window = tk.Tk()
window.title("My First App")

entry = tk.Entry(window)
button = tk.Button(window, text="Say Hello", command=button_clicked)
label = tk.Label(window, text="Enter your name above")

entry.pack()
button.pack()
label.pack()

window.mainloop()
```

**Creative Challenges:**
- Digital Spirograph with mathematical patterns
- Personal Logo Generator
- Simple Paint Program
- Animated Story with moving characters
